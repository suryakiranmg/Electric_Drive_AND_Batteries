## CO2 Emission Estimation of EV Batteries through it's Lifecycle


### The goal of this project is to develop a robust methodology for calculating the carbon footprint of EV batteries throughout their entire lifecycle. This will provide stakeholders with detailed insights into carbon emissions associated with each stage of battery production and usage.

## Conclusions

- The calculated CO2 Emissions of EV battery in 1st Life is found to be approx. xxxxxx
- With the Avoided Burden approach; the overall CO2 Emissions for the EV battery through itâ€™s Life Cycle is significantly lower than ICE Vehicles. 
- Even when considering the higher emissions from the manufacturing phase (due to the battery), the long-term operational savings from cleaner energy use outweigh the initial carbon burden.
- EVs can potentially be Carbon-Neutral or even Carbon-Negative over their lifetime if the energy grid becomes cleaner and if innovations in battery manufacturing (such as increased efficiency & reduced use of rare materials) continue.
