## As responsibility of vehicle motion shifts from drivers to product developers, are the product developers prepared to take that responsibility?

As autonomous driving technologies advance, the responsibility for vehicle motion will shift from drivers to product developers. While major progress is being made, there's still a long way ahead before full autonomy becomes a reality — so we're not quite there yet.

### Towards Full Autonomy:

__Technology & safety:__ Product developers are leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Advanced sensors (LiDAR, Radar, Cameras, Ultrasonics), AI algorithms with 360-degree environmental perception in real-time, HD maps, Over-the-Air updates to refine the systems continuously, and redundant and fail-safe mechanisms to enhance safety and reliability of autonomous navigation.  
Despite all these, systems struggle with edge cases like rare scenarios, extreme weather conditions, unpredictable pedestrian behaviors etc. Also ensuring cybersecurity is a challenge.
Regulations & Liability: Product developers must navigate evolving regulations like ISO26262, UNECE WP.29 and ISO/SAE 21434 (automotive cybersecurity management systems), and liability is being shifted from drivers to manufacturers for Level3+ autonomy. In many cases, developers are ahead of regulations, making it difficult to determine what constitutes "safe" or "acceptable" behavior for these vehicles.
The "black box" nature of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) makes them non-deterministic and non-repeatable. Also, regulatory fragmentation between different countries/regions complicates global deployment.
Ethics & Public Trust:  Product Developers face scrutiny over how AI systems prioritize safety in unavoidable accidents. The latest Cyber truck accident (Feb 2025) - where the truck failed to merge out of a lane that was ending, hit the curb and crashed into a pole - is a warning sign about the safety of the technology. 
Despite the promises of ‘immense improvements’ after every safety incident from automakers; AI systems still lack the cognitive adaptability of human drivers.
Infrastructure Readiness: Most roads rely heavily on human drivers' judgment, such as interpreting unclear road signs or making split-second decisions in complex driving situations. Autonomous vehicles, on the other hand, need clear & consistent infrastructure to function effectively. For our roads to be AV ready, we need Better Road Signage and Markings, Smart Traffic Signals, 5G + networks, Dedicated short range communications, and Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. 
V2V enables vehicles to share information about their speed, location, and intentions, while V2I allows communication between vehicles and traffic infrastructure, like traffic lights or toll booths. 
How would you feel if a self-driving car had to make a life-and-death decision?

Take the case of the trolley problem, a classic ethical dilemma, involving a choice between two undesirable outcomes-where a decision has to be made to kill 1 person to save 5 others or vice versa or self-destroy to save everyone else. How should the vehicle behave in situations where harm is inevitable? 
V2V communication could help autonomous vehicles make more informed, coordinated, and potentially less ethically problematic decisions in these types of scenarios. Vehicles can inform each other about their actions and intentions – potentially avoiding isolated decision making like swerving into a dangerous area. 
Now, dilemmas are deeply subjective – V2V can’t completely solve the trolley problem but it can help AVs make more informed context-aware decisions.
Are product developers ready?
Yes, product developers are making significant progress in preparing for the increased responsibility of vehicle motion control, yet they are not fully ready. This is a highly evolving field and only time will tell if these bold claims can be realized or not. 
Ultimately, preparedness varies by company – GM recently closed Cruise after many challenges. Some companies, like Waymo, Tesla & some Chinese OEMs, are known for aggressively pushing forward with AV technology. 
The race to full autonomy is a marathon with many hurdles along the way and it’s about redefining responsibility in a world where “human driver error” becomes “product developer error”!
