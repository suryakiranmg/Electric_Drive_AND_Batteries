# “If I had Asked My Customers What They Wanted, They Would Have Said a Faster Horse” – Henry Ford


Henry Ford's famous quote, "If I had asked my customers what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse," encapsulates the idea of revolutionary innovation—products that completely change the landscape, often in ways that customers didn't even know they wanted. In the early days of automobiles, consumers couldn't envision a car because their understanding was limited to horses.

One example is the **iPhone (2007)**: Before the iPhone, people were using flip phones and basic mobile phones primarily for calls and text messages. If you had asked customers what they wanted, they might have said "a better battery" or "a phone with a better camera." Instead, Apple revolutionized the concept of a mobile phone by introducing a touchscreen that combined a phone, media player, internet browser, and later, a powerful app ecosystem. The iPhone completely redefined what a smartphone could be and continues to refine them.


The rise of **electric vehicles (EVs)**, led by Tesla, is another classic case of transformative innovation that redefined an entire industry. Before Tesla, EVs were seen as impractical, with limited range, slow charging, uninspiring designs and low performance (stereotyping of EVs as "glorified golf carts.") and many people believed electric cars were only for eco-conscious buyers who valued sustainability over performance. Popular automakers weren’t seriously pursuing mass-market EVs; the general mindset was that people wanted better gas-powered cars or some sort of hybrid vehicle as the ideal solution to save on fuel without giving up on the convenience and performance of traditional cars.


Tesla redefined what an electric car could be, they reimagined the automobile as a, **high-performance machine**, offering long-range vehicles that were environmentally friendly with a fast-charging infrastructure that eliminated “range anxiety”; a key psychological barrier to EV adoption. Their cars didn’t look like the clunky, utilitarian EVs of the past. Instead, they were sleek, modern, equipped with cutting-edge technology. Owning a Tesla wasn’t just about driving an electric car; it was a statement about being part of a forward-thinking movement; showing that sustainability doesn’t have to come at the cost of performance or style.


While legacy automakers were caught up in the ‘faster horse’ mindset – Tesla’s disruption extended beyond cars to accompanying energy products (solar roofs, Powerwall batteries, home charging systems). By combining autonomous driving with these innovations, it sparked a cultural shift turning EVs into an aspirational lifestyle rather than just a sustainable choice.


Tesla’s innovations, from the Solar Roof to the Powerwall, and the integration of these systems with EVs, also represent a revolutionary shift in how we think about energy. By creating a smooth connection between energy generation (through solar power), energy storage (via Powerwall), and energy consumption (through EVs) it is showing the way toward a **future where homes and businesses can be grid energy independent, solely powered by renewable resources.**


Chinese and European companies are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, making electric mobility more accessible, affordable, and integrated with renewable energy systems. Companies in China are developing cutting-edge battery technologies driving down the cost, increasing range and safety. BYD, SAIC, NIO, Xpeng, and Li Auto have been making huge strides in developing EVs that cater to a broad range of consumers, from affordable compact cars to premium vehicles.


While Tesla revolutionized EVs (Model S – 2012), early models like the Nissan Leaf (2010) GM EV1(1996) and the Toyota Prius (1997) hybrid laid the groundwork. Their success also hinged on advancements in Li-ion battery technology, battery production and manufacturing (Led by CATL, BYD, LG Chem, Panasonic), strong international collaboration, timing, ecosystem readiness through government support, subsidies, emissions regulations, pre-existing environmental awareness and policy shifts. Similarly, prior advancements in touchscreen and smartphone developments (e.g., BlackBerry, Palm Pilot) paved the way for Apple’s success. These breakthroughs are built on prior technologies, blending incremental and disruptive progress.

Customers didn’t know they wanted a product until someone showed them a **better, cleaner, and smarter solution**—proving that solving "impossible" problems often starts with questioning the status quo, integrating existing technologies (touchscreens, lithium-ion batteries) with bold vision and continually refining them.
