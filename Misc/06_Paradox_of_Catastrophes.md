**We have been in business meetings where everyone says, “We’re on course relative to our plan,” yet an honest look at current reality would show otherwise.**

# Why do organizations seem incapable of recognizing catastrophes before they occur?

In catastrophic failures like the GM Ignition, Boeing 737 Max, etc., the after-event investigation often unearths some obvious clues leading to disaster. __*Why are we unable to see obvious catastrophes in advance?*__
_________________________________________________________________________________

Historical examples like the GM ignition scandal and Boeing 737 Max crashes illustrate this paradox. Post-crisis investigations consistently uncover glaring oversights that, in hindsight, appear obvious. Yet, these red flags are often ignored or minimized in real time.

## Case Study: The Boeing 737 Max Crashes (2018–2019)

Competitive pressures may drive hasty decisions, but that’s no excuse for compromising on product quality—especially when the product involves critical safety systems. In Boeing’s case, the **737 Max design flaws** — including inadequate failure mode analysis and missing safeguards for critical sensors — were systemic. Investigations revealed shortcuts across conception, design, testing and compliance phases. While complexity in a new-product to market inevitably introduces risks, Boeing’s response to early warnings were telling!

After the **2018 Lion Air crash**, Boeing deflected accountability by blaming pilot error, despite internal and external dissent. The six-month gap between the first and second crashes (Ethiopian Airlines, 2019) offered a critical opportunity to reassess the flawed **MCAS system**. Instead, Boeing dismissed concerns — even when Ethiopian Airlines directly raised issues about MCAS safety. Only after the second tragedy did grounding, investigations, and fixes begin.

### The Cultural Root Cause

Media reports and whistleblower accounts paint a culture of **suppressed dissent, intimidation, and retaliation**. Engineers and experts with firsthand knowledge of technical risks were sidelined, while leadership — seemingly detached from engineering realities — prioritized optics over accountability. This toxic environment allowed flawed assumptions to go unchallenged. When organizations replace technical rigor with “yes-men” cultures and prioritize short-term gains over systemic safety, catastrophes become inevitable.

### Takeaway

 Catastrophic failures are rarely sudden; they are the culmination of ignored warnings, eroded safeguards, and cultures that silence critical voices. For industries where lives are at stake, fostering transparency, empowering dissent, strong regulatory framework, and prioritizing long-term safety over short-term profits are not optional — they are existential imperatives.

### Redemption through cultural change

When failures are met with humility rather than deflection, they become catalysts for change. A prime example of an organization learning from its past mistakes is **Toyota.**

After the 2009-2011 recall crisis, which involved millions of vehicles being recalled due to unintended acceleration issues, Toyota faced immense scrutiny and damage to its reputation. However, rather than doubling down on its initial responses, Toyota chose to undergo a deep, organizational transformation.

The company invested heavily in improving its quality control processes, revamped its safety protocols, and embraced its founding philosophy of __*kaizen*__ (continuous improvement), decentralizing decision-making to empower engineers and frontline workers to flag risks without bureaucratic delays. Most critically, it shifted from a “cost-first” mindset to *__prioritizing safety as a non-negotiable__* value, even at the expense of short-term profits.


The crisis forced Toyota to confront cultural complacency—proving that even legacy organizations can rebuild trust by institutionalizing lessons from failure.
